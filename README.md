# MCC-Region-Selector
MCC-Region-Selector is a basic app that allows players of **Halo: The Master Chief Collection (PC)** to select which server regions they wish to play in, as the game does not have this feature built-in.

Note: This app may also affect server regions in other **Xbox Game Studios**' games, such as Gears 5 *(if that's a good thing for you or not)*.

## How to use
1. Open the app.
2. Select the server regions you wish to play in.
3. Press **Apply**.

Server regions can be selected or unselected at anytime. No irreversible is done, so don't worry if you change your mind later.

## How it works
The app works by modifying the **hosts** file on your computer, located at *C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc* and blocking certain Microsoft servers that Halo: The Master Chief Collection depends on.
